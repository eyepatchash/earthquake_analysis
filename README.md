# Earthquake Analysis 

## Overview 

This Assignment uses Pyspark and python  to analyze earthquake data and visualizes it on an interactive map using Folium. 

### Packages

- Python 3.x
- PySpark (And all dependencies along with it )
- Folium 

### Functionalities  

* Filter data so that the data set contains only magnitude abvoe 5.
  Creates two UDF functions calucalte distance from reference point from earthquake using Haversine Formula and 
          categorize the magnitude into Low, Moderate and High.
* Process them into one processed csv file.
* Visualize them into a interactive wrold map that has clusters for better viewing and pop to know details.
